intence, the scrolling indicator
================================

Intence is a new UX concept and a JavaScript library which reflects
the scrolling state in a simple and intuitive manner. It highlights
the scrollable area depending on the scrolling amount, thus
efficiently explaining to a user what exactly can be scrolled, and is
there much to scroll. Intence is suggested as a scrollbar replacament
for a general designation of a scrollable area. The library is written
in vanilla JavaScript and has no dependencies.
